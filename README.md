# Titanic_prediction
This is a Python program that determines whether a passenger, given a set number of attributes such as age, sex, departure location, and fare paid, would survive the sinking of the Titanic ship.  I used Pandas to read the data and did some preprocessing.I implemented the decision tree algorithm. I tuned the algorithm by changing parameters such as max depth and post pruning. I also tried building the tree and filtering the data till the very end. I calculated the accuracy metrics for training, validation, and testing data.
